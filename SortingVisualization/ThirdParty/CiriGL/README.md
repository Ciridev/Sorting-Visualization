# CiriGL
CiriGL is a Utility Header-Only Library for OpenGL.

# About
CiriGL is in a very early stage of development, and it features only a limited range of modern OpenGL functionality.
I used GLEW and Tested the library on Visual Studio 2019. 

Next main features yet to come: 
- Framebuffer Objects
- Vertex Abstraction
- Font support
- Texture 3D 

# Note 
* Texture.h uses stb_image.h, which i took from https://github.com/nothings/stb.
