# Sorting Visualization
Sorting Visualization of several Algorithms made with OpenGL.

# About
The project has been tested only on Visual Studio 2019. <br>
I used GLFW, GLEW, GLM, ImGui, and my CiriGL library (that uses stb_image.h from stb) <br>

## NOTE:
- This visualization does not show the real time of the sorting algorithm, that's why some procedures have implemented a skip step function expressed in terms of the vector size.
- Naming conventions:
  - Procedure > refers to an actual programming method.
  - Function > refers to an actual mathematical function.
